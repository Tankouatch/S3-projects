This is a sample application designed to illustrate various concepts related to containers on AWS. It presents a sample retail store application including a product catalog, shopping cart and checkout.

It provides:
- A distributed component architecture in various languages and frameworks
- Utilization of a variety of different persistence backends for different components like MySQL, DynamoDB and Redis
- The ability to run in various container orchestration technologies like Docker Compose, Kubernetes etc.
- Pre-built containers image for both x86-64 and ARM64 CPU architectures
- All components instrumented for Prometheus metrics and OpenTelemetry OTLP tracing
- Load generator which exercises all of the infrastructure

## Application Architecture

The application has been deliberately over-engineered to generate multiple de-coupled components. These components generally have different infrastructure dependencies, and may support multiple "backends" (example: Carts service supports MongoDB or DynamoDB).
